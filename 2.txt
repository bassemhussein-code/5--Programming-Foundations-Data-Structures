Evaluate a postfix expression



    you can easily .. compute the postfix expersion by using the a stack ..
    the idea is to traverse throught the given postfix expersion .. from the left .. to .. 
    the right .. if the current character of the expersion (is a operand ) .. push it into the stack ..'
    if the current character of the experssion .. is ( a operator ) .. pop the last two items .. form the 
    stack .. 





   the most important thing .. to push the equivalent   



   again .. push the equivalent .. 



   ex .. if ch =='*":
             stack.append(x*y)
