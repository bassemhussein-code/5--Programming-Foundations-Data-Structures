O(V + M )   where v : num of vertexes .. and M is the num of edges .. 



    strongly connected graph . tell me again .. what does this mean ???? 

     yes .. from any vertex you can reach the rest of the nodes .. 

     so .. there exist .. there exist ... at least on node can reach the rest .. 


        from one vertex .. you can determine if the graph is strongly conncected .. or not .. 

         why we can't choose a random vertex ??   shall we ??  

        yes ,, we can ..

      insteadof looping through the vertexes .. we would choose just one .. ok :)
