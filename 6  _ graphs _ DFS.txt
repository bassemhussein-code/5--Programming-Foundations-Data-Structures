graphs .. dfs 


       strongly connected graphs .. 


    is said to be strongly connected graphs .. if from any node .. you can reach the rest of the nodes of the graphs .. 


   first step in the dfs.. problem 


    you need to construct the Graph class   which allocate the source and destination .. of the adjlist in the graph 

     from each vertex .. there is a list .. adjlist .. its destinations


    second thing .. 
       check function 


          in the check function .. you do DFS function   which should check if you reached the rest vertexes or not..


     if the DFS  funtion .. doesn't reach all the vertexes .. 

         then .. this is not strongly connected graph





     the most important thing .. is ..............   
                                                     time compelxity for this example is O(n X(n+m))          where n : num of vertexes .. m: num of edges
